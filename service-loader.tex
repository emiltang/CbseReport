\section{Java SE Service Loader}

The implementation of the Asteroids game named \emph{AsteroidServiceLoader},
uses the \mintinline{java}|ServiceLoader|\cite{bib:service-loader} from Java
Standard Edition to manage implementation of service interfaces.

Each component declares in its jar its implementations of service interfaces.
For each service implementation there exits a file in the path
\mintinline{bash}|/META-INF/services|,
describing an interface as the file name and an implementation class name as
the file content. 
For example, the service \mintinline{java}|PlayerProcessor| that implements the
interface \mintinline{java}|IProcessor|,
has a file called \mintinline{bash}|com.mycompany.api.IProcessor| with the
contents: \mintinline{bash}|com.mycompany.player.PlayerProcessor|.

The \mintinline{java}|ServiceLoader| can the be called to load all
implementations of the interface.
The class \mintinline{java}|ServiceLocater| from the module
\mintinline{java}|library| includes two helper functions to retrieve services.
The first function, \mintinline{java}|getService()|, returns the first service
that is found and throws and exception if none is found.
The second function, \mintinline{java}|getServices|, returns a list of the
found services.
